# Vanilla ES6 (ES2015) â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

> A port of the [Vanilla JS Example](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/), but translated into ES6, also known as ES2015.

## Learning ES6

- [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
- [Learning Resources](https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning)
- [Babel's ES6 Guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
- [Babel Compiler](https://babeljs.io/)

## Installation

To get started with this example, navigate into the example folder and install the NPM modules.
```bash
cd todomvc/examples/vanilla-es6
npm install
```

## Compiling ES6 to ES5

After NPM modules have been installed, use the pre-defined Babel script to convert the `src` files. Browserify is also used so that `module.exports` and `require()` can be run in your browser.

```bash
npm run compile
```

## Implementation

Uses [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to compile ES6 code to ES5, which is then readable by all browsers.
